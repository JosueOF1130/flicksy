# Flicksy

Flicksy is a movie discovery app built with **React Native** (Expo) that lets you explore movie details, casts, and more using data from [The Movie Database (TMDB)](https://www.themoviedb.org/).  
The app is designed to support both **mobile** and **web** platforms.

- Save / like movies to your personal library
- Theming support (light/dark mode)
- Cross-platform: works on both mobile (Expo/React Native) and web (React Native Web)
### AI-Powered Recommendations  

Flicksy will use **AI** to curate personalized movie recommendations by analyzing a user’s liked movies and their associated genres.  
The recommendation engine will learn from viewing patterns, compare them against TMDB’s dataset, and suggest movies that align with both the user’s preferences and trending titles.  

This ensures every user gets a **tailored discovery experience** instead of generic results.
